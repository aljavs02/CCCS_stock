# CCCS_stock
This project aims to predict the stock prices of CCCS using the ARIMA model.
The primary objective is to develop a time series forecasting model that provides insights into future stock price trends based on historical data.

## Key Components:
- Data Preprocessing: The dataset contains historical stock price data for CCCS, which is cleaned and transformed for time series analysis.
- ARIMA Model: ARIMA is utilized to build a forecasting model based on the stock price data. The model is fine-tuned to achieve optimal predictions.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the ARIMA model is evaluated using metrics such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## Technologies:
- R Programming Language (including tidyverse, quantmod, forecast, tseries, ggplot2, dplyr packages)
- ARIMA Model for time series forecasting
